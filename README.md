Forked from https://github.com/jonhare/nativelibs4java which fixes an issue tp BridJ with loading libraries on OSX Catalina. 

This repository hosts source code for the following (related) projects :

*   [JNAerator](http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/) parses C, C++ and Objective-C headers and generates Java bindings for use with BridJ, JNA or Rococoa

    [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/blob/master/libraries/jnaerator/CHANGELOG) | [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/wiki/JNAeratorFAQ) | [Credits and License](http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/wiki/CreditsAndLicense)
*   [BridJ](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/) is a runtime library that lets Java developers use C/C++ with dynamic bindings (no need to compile any native bindings)

    [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/blob/master/libraries/BridJ/CHANGELOG) | [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/FAQ) | [JavaDoc](http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/bridj/api/development/) | [Credits and License](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/CreditsAndLicense)
*   [JavaCL](http://code.google.com/p/javacl/) provides OpenCL bindings + a high-level object-oriented API that hides away much of the complexity of GPGPU + useful utilities

    [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/blob/master/libraries/OpenCL/CHANGELOG) | [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/javacl/wiki/FAQ) | [JavaDoc](http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/javacl/api/stable/) | [Credits and License](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/CreditsAndLicense)
*   [ScalaCL](http://code.google.com/p/scalacl/) provides GPGPU-powered collections for Scala, with map/filter operations running straight on the GPU (converts Scala code to OpenCL).

    _ScalaCL moved to its own repository: [ochafik/ScalaCL](https://github.com/ochafik/ScalaCL)._

*   [Scalaxy](http://code.google.com/p/scalaxy/) plugs into the Scala compiler to optimize Scala code (in particular, makes for loops much faster)

    _Scalaxy moved to its own repository: [ochafik/Scalaxy](https://github.com/ochafik/Scalaxy)._
